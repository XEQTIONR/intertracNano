# intertracNano

This is a secondary version of the nanoDB app written by Ishtehar Hussain for Intertrac Nano. The web application is written mostly in PHP on Laravel 5.4 Framework.
Following are some basic instructions to get you up and running on how to run this app on a local artisan server (or similar).

1. Requirements.

Some general requirements. You may have work-arounds on these.

 1. PHP, Laravel (>=5.4),
 Basically everything you need to a laravel app.

 2. Mysql database.
 You need access to a mysql database where we will create our database schema.

 3. Sparkpost Key
 We send email for password resets. So if you want access to this feature then you need a register a domain on SparkPost and obtain a key for that domain.

 3. Also needs internet to access Bootstrap and Jquery files/scripts/styles etc.


2. Set Up.
  1. Clone or Download the repository

  2. Create a mysql database.
  We have not used database migrations on this project. A sql creation script called 'default_db.sql' is given. You can use this script to create your database tables. Some basic data is also provided.  

  3. Create a ENV file.
  You must create a (.env) file to hold all your environment variables. The following fields must be set.


<code>    

    DB_CONNECTION=mysql
    DB_HOST=your-db-host
    DB_PORT=your-db-port
    DB_DATABASE=your-db-name
    DB_USERNAME=your-db-username
    DB_PASSWORD=your-db-password

    MAIL_DRIVER=sparkpost
    SPARKPOST_KEY=your-secret-sparkpost-key
</code>
  3. Run your server
  The simplest way is to use the artisan console to run a local server
  <code>  php artisan serve</code>


  4. Register an admin
  Insert an entry into the users table.
  id=1
  name=some-name
  email=some-email-you-have-access-to
  password=anything--not-the-real-password
  admin=1

  This will create an admin associated with an email. Now the password must be reset.
  Go to the homepage and click on log-in and then forgot passwords. Follow the instructions on resetting the password. Once the password has been reset you are ready to use the app using all features and admin privileges.
